## Problem 0.1

I ran usethis::create_github_token() in the console to get the token to
push to GitHub.

## Problem 1

I installed the moderndive package in the console. The code chunk below
shows loading the tidyverse package, the moderndive package, and the
early January hourly weather dataset.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The early January hourly weather dataset shows hourly meteorological
data throughout early January 2013 for the 3 airports closest to New
York City: LGA, JFK, and EWR. The dataset contains 15 columns and
`r`nrow(early_january_weather)\` rows. The columns are the variables,
which include the weather station, year, month, day, and hour of
recording, temperature (“temp”, measured in degrees Fahrenheit),
relative humidity (“humid”), wind direction, wind speed, wind gust,
precipitation, and date and hour of recording (“time_hour”, stored as a
single value in seconds as per the POSIXct format). The mean for the
temperature is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit.

The code chunk below shows the creation of the scatter plot of
temperature by time/hour. Darker points indicate lower humidity and
bluer points indicate higher humidity.

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes (x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_smy2122_files/figure-gfm/ggplot-1.png)<!-- -->

The scatter plot above shows that temperatures are higher during the day
and drop somewhat significantly at night. The coldest day is in the
beginning of the month around January 2 while the hottest day is in the
middle of the month around January 14. On average, as the days go on,
both the average temperature and average humidity increase in a positive
linear direction from January 1 to around January 16.

# Problem 2

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10, a logical vector, a character vector, and a factor vector.

``` r
homework_df =
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    logical_vec = samp > 0,
    character_vec = c("banana", "strawberry", "mango", "apple", "grape", "kiwi", "blueberry", "passionfruit", "peach", "dragonfruit"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("overly ripe", "ripe", "ripe", "overly ripe", "ripe", "unripe", "unripe", "unripe", "overly ripe", "ripe"))
    )
```

The code chunk below calculates the mean for the random sample, logical
vector, character vector, and factor vector.

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2759524

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, logical_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, character_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, character_vec)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean could only be calculated for the random sample (mean = 0.129)
and logical vector (mean = 0.5) variables in the data frame. (Note that,
since the random sample changes each time the code is run, the mean for
the random sample and logical vector will change accordingly.) However,
the character vector and factor vector variables are not numeric or
logical and thus return NA.

The next code chunk (which is hidden from the output) converts logical,
character, and factor variables from the data frame into numeric
vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, logical_vec))
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, character_vec))
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, factor_vec))
```

Similar to taking the mean, the logical vector returns numbers of 0 or 1
and the character vectors return NA, which may explain the results for
calculating the mean of the logical and character vectors. However, the
factor vector now returns values of 1, 2, or 3 that correspond to the
order in which levels were assigned, which doe not explain the results
for calculating the mean for the factor vector.
