## Problem 0.1

I ran usethis::create_github_token() in the console to get the token to
push to GitHub.

## Problem 1

I installed the moderndive package in the console. The code chunk below
shows loading the tidyverse package, the moderndive package, and the
early January hourly weather dataset.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The early January hourly weather dataset shows hourly meteorological
data throughout early January 2013 for the 3 airports closest to New
York City: LGA, JFK, and EWR. The dataset contains 15 columns and 358
rows. The columns are the variables, which include the weather station,
year, month, day, and hour of recording, temperature (“temp”, measured
in degrees Fahrenheit and will be used in the upcoming scatter plot),
relative humidity (“humid”, which will be used in the upcoming scatter
plot), wind direction, wind speed, wind gust, precipitation, and date
and hour of recording (“time_hour”, stored as a single value in seconds
as per the POSIXct format and will be used in the upcoming scatter
plot).

The mean for the temperature is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit and the
mean for humidity is 65.4767039.

The code chunk below shows the creation of the scatter plot of
temperature by time/hour. Darker points indicate lower humidity and
bluer points indicate higher humidity.

``` r
ggplot(
  data = early_january_weather,
  aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_smy2122_files/figure-gfm/ggplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave
```

The scatter plot above shows that temperatures are higher during the day
and drop somewhat significantly at night. The coldest day is in the
beginning of the month around January 2 while the hottest day is in the
middle of the month around January 14. On average, as the days go on,
both the average temperature and average humidity increase in a positive
linear direction from January 1 to around January 16.

# Problem 2

The code chunk below creates a data frame comprised of a random sample
of size 10, a logical vector, a character vector, and a factor vector.

``` r
homework_df =
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    logical_vec = samp > 0,
    character_vec = c("banana", "strawberry", "mango", "apple", "grape", "kiwi", "blueberry", "passionfruit", "peach", "dragonfruit"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("overly ripe", "ripe", "ripe", "overly ripe", "ripe", "unripe", "unripe", "unripe", "overly ripe", "ripe"))
    )
```

The code chunk below calculates the mean for the random sample, logical
vector, character vector, and factor vector.

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, samp))
mean(pull(homework_df, logical_vec))
mean(pull(homework_df, character_vec))
mean(pull(homework_df, factor_vec))
```

The mean could only be calculated for the random sample (mean =
-0.1539878) and logical vector (mean = 0.3) variables in the data frame.
(Note that, since the random sample changes each time the code is run,
the mean for the random sample and logical vector will change
accordingly.) However, the character vector and factor vector variables
are not numeric or logical and thus return NA.

The next code chunk (which is hidden from the output) converts logical,
character, and factor variables from the data frame into numeric
vectors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, logical_vec))
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, character_vec))
as.numeric(pull(homework_df, factor_vec))
```

Before converting to a numeric vector, the logical vector returned a
mean. After converting to numeric vectors, the logical vector returns
numbers of 0 or 1. Logical vectors are associated with TRUE or FALSE
values, which are associated with 1 and 0, respectively, by default.
This result after as.numeric is expected because the logical vector was
already associated with numbers.

Before converting to a numeric vector, the character vector did not
return a mean. After converting to a numeric vector, the character
vector continued to result in NAs rather than numbers, and a warning
message that the NAs were introduced by coercion appeared. The inability
to convert the character vector to a numeric vector is expected and may
explain the results for calculating the mean.

Before converting to a numeric vector, the factor vector did not return
a mean. However, after converting to a numeric vector, the factor vector
now returns values of 1, 2, or 3 that correspond to the order in which
levels were assigned. It is therefore clear that converting the factor
vector to a numeric vector was necessary to calculate the mean. The
factor vector was not stored as a numeric value before running
as.numeric, which explains why it did not return a numeric mean value
earlier.
